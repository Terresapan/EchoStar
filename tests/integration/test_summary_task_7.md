7. **Error Recovery Scenarios** - Tests various error conditions and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Advanced Integration Tests

8. **Memory Retrieval After Condensation** - Tests that condensed summaries can be retrieved
9. **Full Conversation Cycle** - Complete 10-turn conversation with condensation at turn 10
10. **Data Integrity** - Ensures memory data maintains integrity through condensation
11. **Performance Monitoring** - Tests performance monitoring during condensation

2. **Fixed variable scope issue** with `recent_memories` in condensation function
3. **Corrected turn count logic** in test expectations

## Test Execution Results

- **Total Tests**: 11
- **Passed**: 11 ✅
- **Failed**: 0 ❌
- **Execution Time**: ~0.31 seconds
