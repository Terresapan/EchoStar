# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the robustness, maintainability, and reliability of the EchoStar AI companionship agent codebase. Based on our analysis and fixes, the improvements address critical areas including memory system reliability, routing consistency, configuration management, type safety, and code resilience to ensure the application runs smoothly in production environments and is easier to maintain and extend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the EchoStar system, I want the memory system to work reliably without crashes, so that conversations can be stored, retrieved, and condensed properly without system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN memory store operations are called THEN the store SHALL be properly initialized and not None
2. ✅ WHEN memory condensation is triggered THEN the system SHALL successfully condense episodic memories into semantic summaries
3. ✅ WHEN condensed memories are saved THEN they SHALL be preserved as complete summaries without fragmentation
4. ✅ WHEN old episodic memories are condensed THEN they SHALL be cleaned up to prevent memory buildup
5. ✅ WHEN memory system fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent execution

### Requirement 2 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a user interacting with EchoStar, I want the system to consistently route my messages to the appropriate response agent, so that I receive contextually appropriate responses based on my message type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN I send simple greetings or factual questions THEN the system SHALL route to echo_respond
2. ✅ WHEN I send gibberish or nonsensical input THEN the system SHALL route to fallback
3. ✅ WHEN I request complex analysis or synthesis THEN the system SHALL route to complex_reasoning
4. ✅ WHEN I share emotional vulnerability THEN the system SHALL route to reflector or reflective_inquiry appropriately
5. ✅ WHEN I ask philosophical questions THEN the system SHALL route to philosopher

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer configuring the EchoStar system, I want centralized configuration management for system parameters, so that I can easily adjust thresholds and settings without modifying code in multiple locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system parameters need to be changed THEN all configuration values SHALL be accessible from a single configuration source
2. WHEN the application starts THEN configuration values SHALL be validated for correctness and completeness
3. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
4. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variable overrides
5. WHEN default values are used THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and reasonable for production use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the EchoStar codebase, I want consistent type annotations throughout the application, so that I can understand function signatures, catch type-related bugs early, and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any function definition THEN it SHALL have complete type annotations for parameters and return values
2. WHEN using optional parameters THEN they SHALL be properly typed with Optional or Union types
3. WHEN working with complex data structures THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN type checking is run THEN it SHALL pass without errors or warnings
5. WHEN new code is added THEN it SHALL follow the established type annotation patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging EchoStar issues, I want comprehensive input validation and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and reject it with clear error messages
2. WHEN critical operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN the system state changes THEN important transitions SHALL be logged for audit purposes
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN timing information SHALL be available in logs for analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the EchoStar system, I want robust LLM API call handling, so that the application gracefully handles rate limits, network issues, and API failures without crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM API calls encounter rate limits THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
3. WHEN API calls fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached responses or default behaviors
4. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and gracefully degrade functionality
5. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors without crashing
