# EchoStar: An AI Personal Companionship Agent

EchoStar is a sophisticated, multi-agent personal companionship AI designed to engage in emotionally complex and psychologically nuanced conversations. Built with LangGraph, LangMem, and Streamlit, this agent uses a multi-layered memory system to foster long-term, meaningful interactions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: A central router classifies incoming messages and directs them to one of several specialized sub-agents, each with a unique persona:
  - **Echo**: For light, casual conversation.
  - **Roleplay**: For romantic and imaginative scenarios.
  - **Reflector**: For deep, emotional reflection.
  - **Philosopher**: For abstract and intellectual discussions.
- **Sophisticated Memory**: The agent's memory is divided into four distinct layers:
  - **Episodic Memory**: Stores the history of conversations.
  - **Semantic Memory**: Stores facts, user preferences, and beliefs.
  - **User Profile**: A comprehensive, evolving profile of the user.
  - **Procedural Memory**: Learns from user feedback to adapt its behavior over time.
- **Planner/Executor Pattern**: For complex queries, the agent uses a planner to outline a multi-step plan and an executor to generate a comprehensive response.
- **Web-Based UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit allows for easy interaction with the agent.
